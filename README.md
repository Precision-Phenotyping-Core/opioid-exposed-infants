Phenotype algorithm to identify opioid-exposed infants using electronic health record (EHR) data.

Observational studies examining outcomes among opioid-exposed infants are limited by phenotype algorithms that may under identify opioid-exposed infants without neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). We developed and validated the performance of different phenotype algorithms to identify opioid-exposed infants using electronic health record (EHR) data.
